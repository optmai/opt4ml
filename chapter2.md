# Chapter 2: Introduction â€” Advanced Machine Learning

> *All models fade, but principles endure!*

## Abstract

In this chapter, we first introduce the traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, using traditional label prediction problems to illustrate three components: loss functions, optimization algorithms, and generalization analysis.

We then delve into advanced learning methods, including distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and group DRO, aimed at enhancing model robustness. Next, we present an advanced learning paradigm called empirical X-risk minimization (EXM) and discuss its applications. Finally, we introduce a new learning paradigm named data prediction for learning foundation models in modern AI with a discriminative X-risk.
