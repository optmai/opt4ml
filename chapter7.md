## Afterwords

Dear Readers: 

Congratulations on making it this far in the book. Even if you haven't read every chapter in full, I hope you've found parts of it useful and inspiring. For practitioners, I hope this book shows that theory can, at times, be genuinely useful in practice. As I reflect on the journey that led to this book, I am reminded of the principle of '知行合一' (Zhi Xing He Yi) by Wang Yangming (a legendary sage of ancient China), cited in the preface. It is often translated as `unity of knowledge and action', which I interpret as the idea that theory should guide practice, and practice can, in turn, inspire theory. 

The framework of Empirical X-risk Minimization (EXM) from a machine-learning perspective or Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (FCCO) from an optimization viewpoint was originally inspired by a real-world challenge: identifying a small number of effective molecules from a vast search space. Building on this practical motivation, a rigorous mathematical foundation was subsequently developed and applied to a broad range of problems in machine learning and AI. Although the framework was initially conceived merely as an optimization tool, I have since come to realize that it is deeply intertwined with fundamental learning principles—most notably discriminative learning and robust optimization. At the same time, it is important to recognize that we are only at the dawn of a new era of Empirical X-risk Minimization.

For decades, the field of machine learning was synonymous with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). However, as we have seen throughout these chapters, the ``X" in EXM represents the diverse and often non-decomposable objectives—be it AUC, ranking measures, cross-entropy loss or contrastive losses—that define the frontier of modern AI. The development of the LibAUC library and the success of the EXM framework in AI challenges have shown us that when we move beyond standard stochastic optimization, we unlock new levels of performance in critical domains like medical imaging and drug discovery. Yet, despite these successes, the systematic study of EXM is just beginning.

During my years as a graduate student, I immersed myself in many books of optimization and machine learning, which were instrumental in building my mathematical foundation. Now, after a decade of dedicated study and research, I am humbled to synthesize these insights and my own findings into this book. It is my sincere hope that the methods and theories presented in this book serve not as a final destination, but as a catalyst. I hope this work inspires researchers to look beyond the standard training loops and discover new ``X-risks" that better capture the nuances of human intelligence and societal needs. I look forward to seeing how the next generation of researchers will apply these principles to generate even greater impact, bridging the gap between elegant mathematical theory and the transformative applications of tomorrow.
