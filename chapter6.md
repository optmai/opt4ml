# Chapter 6: Applications â€” Learning Predictive, Generative and Representation Models

> *Unity of knowledge and action!*

## Abstract

In this chapter, we present applications of **stochastic compositional optimization** and **finite-sum coupled compositional optimization (FCCO)** in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings. These include training predictive models, generative models, and representation models using advanced objective functions such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO), group DRO (GDRO), AUC losses, NDCG loss, discriminative X-risks and contrastive losses. We also highlight a key application of FCCO in solving multiple inequality-constrained optimization problems.
